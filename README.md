Create a web app (desktop or mobile) that provides a query box and a search button and then calls the Places Library for Google Maps (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places). Format the results to give a good user experience.

* Use Bower to manage front end packages
* Use Gulp as build system
* Use Google Maps Places API

Users can:
* Search places using Google Maps Places API
* Query box has Autocomplete functionality
* Result shows places photo, name, location, and links to official website (if applicable)
